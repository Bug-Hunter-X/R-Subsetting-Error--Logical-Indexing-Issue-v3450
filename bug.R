```R
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using logical indexing, but it contains a subtle error.
data <- data.frame(A = c(1, 2, 3), B = c(4, 5, 6))

# Incorrect subsetting.  The condition evaluates to a single logical value.
subsetted_data <- data[data$A > 1 & data$B < 6, ]

# The error lies in the way the logical indexing is performed. 
# The condition "data$A > 1 & data$B < 6" doesn't correctly select rows where both conditions are met.
# In this example, it evaluates to TRUE only when BOTH conditions are true. 
# Since row 3 is not in this case, there are no rows satisfying the condition and the subsetted_data is empty

print(subsetted_data)
